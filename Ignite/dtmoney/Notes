Export and Export default

-- When you use EXPORT DEFAULT, where u import the component, u can use the name that u watchman
-- Using just EXPORT (like export function), the name that will be used, is the same that the export component, you cannot define the name

The FIRST step is: 

- Remove all useless files
- Add global Styles (inside styles/global.ts and use as component)


JSON-SERVER
- We can use to create "mock routes" to use, like a fake api server

MIRAGE-JS
- Build a fake api inside the front end
- This is better because has a integrated database and we can build relations

MSW (Mock service worker)
- Its a good option as well, but does not have a lot of features like mirage-js

POLISHED - Manipulate colors
