Each file inside pages folder, will be a route (IMPORTANT)

index.js is the main file

// Just to add typescript
yarn add typescript @types/react @types/node -D
And change the files from .js to tsx

Files with: .module.css, its a scoped css
Install vsCode css modules plugin

The css module will be used together with Sass

yarn add sass

home.module.css -> home.module.scss, now we can use the cascade css

_app will be around all pages

- Everytime that the user changes page, the app is executed again

When using NextJs, the images always will be inside the public folder

Use Stripe to payment methods

1 - Create a product
2 - API Keys (publishable key)

Inside the Api folder, all files created will be routes
